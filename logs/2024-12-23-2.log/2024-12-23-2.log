[23:45:26] [Async Chat Thread - #104/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> he was simply in a small holding place so no zombies could get in for one day whiole the harbor house was built
[23:45:33] [Async Chat Thread - #104/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> he was literally out in the open this morning
[23:45:33] [Async Chat Thread - #104/INFO]: <ppr> girl

[23:46:30] [Async Chat Thread - #104/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> therefore no zombides
[23:46:42] [Async Chat Thread - #104/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> it was likely it sleeping and then accidentally suffocating in a block, which I do agree is on my bad
[23:46:51] [Async Chat Thread - #104/INFO]: <ppr> or
[23:46:54] [Async Chat Thread - #104/INFO]: <ppr> u killed them
