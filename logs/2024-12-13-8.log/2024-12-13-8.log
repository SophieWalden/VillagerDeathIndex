[17:01:36] [Server thread/INFO]: SoapieTomato issued server command: /mctop mining
[17:01:43] [Async Chat Thread - #48/INFO]: <bwjr2> i heard there was a fill command
[17:01:50] [Async Chat Thread - #48/INFO]: <bwjr2> that would make it super easy
[17:02:04] [Async Chat Thread - #48/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> oh lmao that might be the most chaotic command in all of minecraft
[17:02:15] [Async Chat Thread - #48/INFO]: <bwjr2> ??????
[17:02:19] [Async Chat Thread - #48/INFO]: <bwjr2> how so?
[17:02:48] [Async Chat Thread - #48/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> you can mass fill thousands of blocks based on some cordinates, very easy to get one off and fill in weird places or get thousands of tnt spawned
[17:03:03] [Async Chat Thread - #48/INFO]: <bwjr2> ohgod lol
[17:03:37] [Async Chat Thread - #48/INFO]: <bwjr2> so its coordinate based? tbh i was more thinking like you make an outline out of blocks then it fills it
[17:03:54] [Async Chat Thread - #48/INFO]: <bwjr2> theres only one other game ive played that has that mechanic
[17:03:55] [Async Chat Thread - #48/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> oh yea no you tell it two cordinates and it fills in everthing between those two wiht a block
[17:04:08] [Async Chat Thread - #48/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> and you can onyl do like up to 10000 blocks at a time or soemting
[17:04:12] [Async Chat Thread - #48/INFO]: <bwjr2> that sounds like it could be disastrous tbh

[18:08:32] [Server thread/INFO]: SoapieTomato issued server command: /unarmed
[18:08:39] [Async Chat Thread - #70/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> I think it does make it do more damage a good amount

[18:58:39] [Async Chat Thread - #88/INFO]: <bwjr2> now i can actually finish enchanting leggings
[18:58:49] [Async Chat Thread - #88/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> haha I havent even got thorns yet
[18:59:17] [Async Chat Thread - #88/INFO]: <bwjr2> i think theres a guy that gives thorns (might not be labeled) in world trade center
[18:59:36] [Async Chat Thread - #88/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> oh sick I usually dont even put it on for max enchants
[18:59:45] [Async Chat Thread - #88/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> dont want its damage as much
[19:00:01] [Async Chat Thread - #88/INFO]: <bwjr2> i see yeyeye
[19:01:34] [Async Chat Thread - #90/INFO]: <bwjr2> theres actually this crazy ancient city method i found where you literally bomb the ancient city with tnt then pick up loot
[19:01:45] [Async Chat Thread - #90/INFO]: <bwjr2> wait
[19:01:49] [Async Chat Thread - #90/INFO]: <bwjr2> i just realised
[19:01:50] [Async Chat Thread - #90/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> haha yeah you can make carpet bomberrs
[19:01:54] [Async Chat Thread - #90/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> the slime block machine tnt launchers
[19:02:35] [Async Chat Thread - #90/INFO]: <bwjr2> wardens could be so good for levelling combat stuff that is hit based
[19:02:48] [Async Chat Thread - #90/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> I guess since they dont die that easily
[19:02:51] [Async Chat Thread - #90/INFO]: <bwjr2> wait
[19:02:57] [Async Chat Thread - #90/INFO]: <bwjr2> shockwave attack
[19:02:58] [Async Chat Thread - #90/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> but also theyre annoing to trap and keep alive
[19:03:04] [Async Chat Thread - #90/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> yeah andthey can shoot trhoguh walsl
[19:03:55] [Async Chat Thread - #90/INFO]: <bwjr2> tbh i dont like how much of a nuisance they are, makes looting ancient cities super tedious
[19:04:14] [Async Chat Thread - #90/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> yeah I mean I think they supposed to be really difficult wish there was better loot there
[19:04:18] [Async Chat Thread - #91/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> supopsed to be endgame stff
[19:05:44] [Async Chat Thread - #92/INFO]: <bwjr2> i just realised emerson might surpass finn in playtime
[19:06:14] [Async Chat Thread - #92/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> nahh Fin has a lead of like 1.2 million ticks which is about 8-9 hours
[19:06:24] [Async Chat Thread - #92/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> but maybe
[19:06:42] [Async Chat Thread - #92/INFO]: <bwjr2> ah that explains why i rose so fast in playtime
[19:06:47] [Async Chat Thread - #92/INFO]: <bwjr2> i nolife the game
[19:07:02] [Async Chat Thread - #92/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> it is interestingn ow though becuase its measured in ticks before it would count as less playtime the laggier the server is but now the server should be stable
[19:07:02] [Async Chat Thread - #92/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> haha
[19:09:05] [Async Chat Thread - #94/INFO]: <bwjr2> i just realised that after you get a few items you pretty much dont ever have to go to ancient city again
[19:09:13] [Async Chat Thread - #95/INFO]: <bwjr2> i mean there is enchanted gapples but
[19:09:18] [Async Chat Thread - #95/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> yeah I just wanted the silence trims
[19:09:18] [Async Chat Thread - #95/INFO]: <bwjr2> those are not worth it tbh
[19:09:33] [Async Chat Thread - #95/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> and besides that I might go to get skulk sensors bc cool for redsotne
[19:09:35] [Async Chat Thread - #95/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> but besides that
[19:10:24] [Async Chat Thread - #95/INFO]: <bwjr2> even with that in many parts of the deep dark you can get the sensors without getting yanked by warden
[19:10:37] [Async Chat Thread - #95/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> fair darkness is just really annoying
[19:12:39] [Server thread/INFO]: SoapieTomato issued server command: /nick
[19:13:06] [Async Chat Thread - #96/INFO]: <bwjr2> bro finns base looks so pretty on the map mod i use

[19:14:15] [Async Chat Thread - #97/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> whats the big house thing
[19:14:18] [Async Chat Thread - #97/INFO]: <bwjr2> i feel like this island is too small for big structures
[19:14:24] [Async Chat Thread - #97/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> oph on the floating island?
[19:14:24] [Async Chat Thread - #97/INFO]: <bwjr2> the one building on the island

[19:14:28] [Async Chat Thread - #97/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> I make it looks sick'
[19:14:31] [Async Chat Thread - #97/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> I think you just need more islands
[19:15:01] [Async Chat Thread - #97/INFO]: <bwjr2> idk what to do with the house though thats the thing lol
[19:15:39] [Async Chat Thread - #97/INFO]: <bwjr2> and i just figured out cartogrpahers are kinda useless in java
[19:15:42] [Async Chat Thread - #97/INFO]: <bwjr2> wait
[19:15:55] [Async Chat Thread - #97/INFO]: <bwjr2> i should make it into a little villager house
[19:16:12] [Async Chat Thread - #96/INFO]: <SoapieTomato> yeye like little town societies
[19:16:21] [Async Chat Thread - #96/INFO]: <bwjr2> or i could expand it to make a little farmer/ranching area
[19:16:28] [Async Chat Thread - #96/INFO]: <bwjr2> the bilding i mean
[19:18:40] [Async Chat Thread - #98/INFO]: <bwjr2> the map tells me that theres an amethyst thingy near a spawn area
