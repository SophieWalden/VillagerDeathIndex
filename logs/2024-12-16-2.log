[17:45:15] [Async Chat Thread - #18/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> or if it should be more spread out to give time for just decorations as opposed to structures
[17:45:25] [Async Chat Thread - #18/INFO]: <Rabbit> yeah the only thing i would say is that buildings tend to run a little bigger than u think they will
[17:45:37] [Async Chat Thread - #18/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> yeah thats the funk with putting buildings next to each other
[17:45:41] [Async Chat Thread - #18/INFO]: <Rabbit> u might wanna combine some or move stuff apart more?
