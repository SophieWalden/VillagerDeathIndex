[20:38:54] [Async Chat Thread - #44/INFO]: <ppr> oh?
[20:39:02] [Async Chat Thread - #44/INFO]: <BjornDetective> we should wander at some point and check out the cementary thats right, but besides that
[20:39:07] [Async Chat Thread - #44/INFO]: <BjornDetective> bridger couldnt have gone far with him
[20:39:14] [Async Chat Thread - #44/INFO]: <BjornDetective> theres a chance he's been under our noses this whole time
[20:39:20] [Async Chat Thread - #44/INFO]: <BjornDetective> the most likely place Gorge has been
[20:39:20] [Async Chat Thread - #44/INFO]: <ppr> ?
[20:39:34] [Async Chat Thread - #44/INFO]: <BjornDetective> was in the Moonlit harbor or the maiden base all along

[20:39:46] [Async Chat Thread - #44/INFO]: <ppr> i'm not sure i follow
[20:39:55] [Async Chat Thread - #44/INFO]: <BjornDetective> its just if Gorge was taken from the maiden base
[20:40:11] [Async Chat Thread - #44/INFO]: <BjornDetective> theres only a couple nearby areas he could've been transported to
[20:40:18] [Async Chat Thread - #44/INFO]: <BjornDetective> he couldve been taken to Aden !!!!!
[20:40:30] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> we should serach their streets, I have heard refuges go there aswell

[20:55:47] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> I dont think we've had a sorcerres in the maidenline before, but she might drop some crazy patch notes soon
[20:55:51] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <ppr> like the terminator?
[20:56:05] [Server thread/INFO]: bwjr issued server command: /gamemode creative
[20:56:05] [Server thread/INFO]: [bwjr: Set own game mode to Creative Mode]
[20:56:05] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> I hope a terminator for the people
[20:56:08] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> well that sounds bad

[20:56:18] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> I mean a terminator that cna help the people again traditional zombie problems
[20:56:27] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <ppr> terminator movie 2
[20:56:34] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> electric boogaloo
[20:57:02] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> I havent seen Luna in a couple moons though, I heard rumors she might appear back looking for contract work
[20:57:07] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> as a freelancer sorcerer
[20:57:23] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <ppr> oh??
[20:57:54] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> idk, shes been on this whole protection kick after a couple tragic deaths that i have yet to be able to investigate
[20:58:03] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> I did figure out the case of the murerous hearts the other day !!
[20:58:20] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <ppr> murerous hearts?
[20:58:49] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> it seemed to be appaering in death messages, just a pair of hearts which was killing many, villager and animals alike, and the maiden was seemed to be blamed for it
[20:59:04] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <ppr> ah yes, those hearts
[20:59:24] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> but the messages seem to continue even withotut the maiden
[20:59:29] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> so i investigated the cause
[20:59:36] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <ppr> what did u find??
[20:59:47] [Server thread/INFO]: bwjr issued server command: /time set day
[20:59:47] [Server thread/INFO]: [bwjr: Set the time to 1000]
[21:00:11] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> well, theres been a recent magical acompiant to the server recently, it seems that there are more displays of a mobs health then ever before
[21:00:19] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> when you slay a cow, you see the hearts
[21:00:22] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> thats what I knew
[21:00:46] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> well if theres a mob that has been hit and then it kills another mob, its named at the time of death is set to its amount of hearts
[21:00:57] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> therefore attributing the kill to seemingly just a pile of hearts
[21:01:20] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> that means all villager deaths retroactively were events of a zombie killing a villager, but someone actively trying to kill the zombie hwen the villager died
[21:01:48] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <ppr> hmmm, interesting theory
[21:02:12] [Async Chat Thread - #45/INFO]: <BjornDetective> and that's how I was able to prove, atlesat to the maidenbase that Luna was not behind the series of heart killings
