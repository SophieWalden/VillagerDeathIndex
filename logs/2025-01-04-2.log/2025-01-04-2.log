[16:44:22] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> i think to comfort my woes of americas steadily failing train infrastructure i need to construct a good train insfrastructure in this world
[16:44:38] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <ppr> omg can i help?
[16:45:09] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> omg yes, the basis is I need to layout good places for train stations near differetn towns
[16:45:21] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> i truly think we can have some area thats a hub naer / along the iron road
[16:45:31] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <ppr> that'd be cute
[16:45:46] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <ppr> how big should a train station be?
[16:45:56] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> you remember the new york subway?
[16:46:01] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> actually maybe not a subway
[16:46:06] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <ppr> gd, grand central?
[16:46:25] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> the problem is I feel like i would be sad if its an underground train so in constructing train law I think we gotta keep this business all above ground
[16:46:39] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> okay, well maybe like not so grand central
[16:46:46] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> moderate centralk
[16:47:08] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> also im so close, got enough skulls for 57 stars
[16:47:15] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <ppr> you could just have the hub be underground, then the train could pop back up near by or smth. i do agree for scenic reasons it should be above ground
[16:47:24] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <ppr> eyo eyo nice
[16:47:30] [Async Chat Thread - #22/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> ooh, yeah I think that would allow us to build a slightly bigger hub
[16:47:36] [Async Chat Thread - #23/INFO]: <ppr> imma farm for a bit, but down to help :O
[16:47:59] [Async Chat Thread - #23/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> I do love Fin's idea tho to have the departature stations start as a real train and then you just minecrat ride out of it
[16:48:10] [Async Chat Thread - #23/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> okie okie imma figure out some materials and spots for it
[16:48:12] [Async Chat Thread - #23/INFO]: <ppr> v cute

[19:40:33] [Async Chat Thread - #54/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> this looks so dimensional
[19:40:39] [Async Chat Thread - #54/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> it could be like a portal into space

[19:42:06] [Async Chat Thread - #55/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> ooh those have great texture
[19:42:18] [Async Chat Thread - #55/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> i mean if your trying to keep it within the realms of the oxidized coppper color
[19:42:25] [Async Chat Thread - #55/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> the ocean monument prismarine might be adjacent
[19:42:26] [Async Chat Thread - #55/INFO]: <bwjr2> it would give good contrast, too
[19:44:02] [Async Chat Thread - #56/INFO]: <bwjr2> i could use walls but i dont wqnt the villagers to get stuck...
