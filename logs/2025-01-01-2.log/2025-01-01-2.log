[10:31:40] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> idk for complete copper blocks this is a while
[10:31:42] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <haashthetag> compared to mining clear across the map!!
[10:31:46] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> haha fair
[10:31:49] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> are you also putting a rail dwon there?
[10:31:52] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <haashthetag> i got so much copper
[10:31:55] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <haashthetag> yeah
[10:31:59] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> thats actually so fair
[10:32:03] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> it prolly just atkes forver to smelt
[10:32:08] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <haashthetag> yep
[10:32:14] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> wait you already know how to use minecarts
[10:32:20] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> this is sick as heck
[10:32:20] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <haashthetag> so I'm thinking about a rail system for smelting
[10:32:30] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <haashthetag> come see my room
[10:32:34] [Server thread/INFO]: haashthetag issued server command: /home treasure
[10:32:35] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> okie okie one sec
[10:32:39] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> hanging in the minecart
[10:32:48] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <haashthetag> lol
[10:33:16] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <haashthetag> I want to hide the rail and the hoppers and chests behind and on top of my furnace wall, and interact with them from my hallway. Have a drop off box there, and a pick up box.
[10:33:30] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> oooo
[10:33:41] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> yeye im always just worried about water
[10:33:48] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <haashthetag> I can block that oof
[10:34:02] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <haashthetag> water is no worry for me! lol after mining through underwater caves
[10:34:05] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> redrock and water mix so poorly. water will destroy any redrock component it can be a apain
[10:34:08] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> haha
[10:34:35] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> but no that would be sick you really easy could make a hopper wall
[10:34:46] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <haashthetag> yeah... going to try to figure it out
[10:34:58] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> hoppers automatically also give to hoppers below them so you may not even need rails you can just put an array of hoppers
[10:35:07] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> this is a cute base top
[10:35:08] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> tho*
[10:35:20] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <haashthetag> but don't i need a rail to feed the ore evenly to the hoppers?
[10:35:34] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> thats fair yea it wouldnt go evenly
[10:35:42] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> the bottom would just take them all in that scenario
[10:35:48] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <haashthetag> right
[10:35:57] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> hmm, evenly is always hard when they are this adjacent to each other
[10:36:17] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <haashthetag> yeah.. I don't know what I'm doing, so it's all an experiment
[10:36:25] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> haha fair, still the minecart train is sick
[10:36:26] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> wait wait
[10:36:31] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <haashthetag> i think I need a comparator thingy or something like that
[10:36:33] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> halfway trhough is it fine if the maidne takes over the rails
[10:36:42] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> perchance percahnce can I make it out of iron
[10:36:54] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> (idk if thats too ugly or you are just on the coppper grind)
[10:37:05] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <haashthetag> i'm on the copper grind!
[10:37:14] [Async Chat Thread - #6/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> haha maidenbless it does look really cute
