[12:01:39] [Async Chat Thread - #4/INFO]: <bwjr2> can i have an opinion on something?
[12:01:43] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> sureusre
[12:01:46] [Server thread/INFO]: SoapieTomato issued server command: /tp bwjr2
[12:01:55] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <bwjr2> how does this little section look
[12:02:03] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> ooh I like the non oxidization as it goes further in
[12:02:11] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> leans really well if theres a copper theme in the train stop
[12:02:22] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> plus traditionally its just good lighting with the trapdoors and dimensionality
[12:02:41] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <bwjr2> i sorta feel like the stairs at the bottom of the pillar detract from its mingling with the rest of the build
[12:03:05] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> yeah, I was gonna say the only blocks that I feel like clash are these storng non oxidized coppper stairs down here
[12:03:21] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> hmm
[12:03:32] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <bwjr2> it still looks weird tbh
[12:03:35] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> i just think its a matter of gradient and slowly intrdocuing it
[12:03:36] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> but I do agree
[12:03:46] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> I cant tell if its just bc of stair bc its funky to have a little vertical texture there
[12:03:57] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <bwjr2> ye
[12:04:06] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> like thats not even bad
[12:04:13] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> it makes it feel much more full
[12:04:21] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <bwjr2> yeye i agree
[12:04:22] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <bwjr2> wait
[12:04:51] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <bwjr2> and...
[12:04:56] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> ye just expand n the outside
[12:05:17] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> i think that looks sick bc its like there are inlets to the arches and multiple arches mashed together of differnet sizes
[12:05:28] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> but no this looks reall sick on the outside
[12:05:37] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> dimensionality be crazy
[12:05:45] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <bwjr2> trutru
[12:06:01] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> I think its because of the mix of cut copper and regular but kinda loving thi8s arch

[12:06:44] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <bwjr2> if you want when i have it decently completed inside you can save it with building block
