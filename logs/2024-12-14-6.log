[11:33:51] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <Rabbit> will there perhaps be a banquet held in ur honor
[11:33:55] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <Rabbit> for ur new rise to the throne
[11:34:27] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> :O Thats so cool. I've honestly been locked away in my wizards tower for so long I havent mustered to explore the lands I would love to see Aden at some point
[11:35:04] [Async Chat Thread - #2/INFO]: <Rabbit> whats your address?? i could send you stuff from the outside world :O
[11:35:06] [Async Chat Thread - #1/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> No, it was quite a sudden transition, not even any of her items managed to make it to me, after re-acquiring and getting setup I will hold a ceremony though
[11:36:10] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> well thats the embarrassing part, I come from pretty afar and my main wizard tower has yet to been built yet, that is the first project the Maiden society is working on as a new base of operations
[11:36:29] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Rabbit> :OO
[11:36:55] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Rabbit> well, i hope the transition of power and your banquet go well
[11:37:25] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> tyty <3 :3 today is just the struggle to get on my feet after the crazy circumstances last night
[11:37:45] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Rabbit> am i allowed to ask if you murdered the last iron maiden?
[11:37:55] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Rabbit> or is that heresy
[11:37:57] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> haha no, that would be preposterious
[11:38:03] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Rabbit> well then i wont ask
[11:38:45] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> I will just say though it is tragic that no trace of her was ever found, but alas just a notification and transportation of my Maidenhood was adonned and society has to continue
[11:39:16] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Rabbit> if one were to perhaps want to send mail to the iron maiden would the same mail spot still work o.o
[11:40:06] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> Yes !! I am a maiden of legacy and hope to keep all of our well established connections still intact even if im new to this whole thing
[11:40:34] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Rabbit> of course, of course
[11:40:49] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <Rabbit> well, long may She reign! or whatever you iron folks say
[11:41:04] [Async Chat Thread - #3/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> haha, the iron lady will reign strong
[11:45:37] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> also perchance for the swing event tonight do you want to meet up early like 5:30-6 hangout and practice whatever dancing we'll pull out. Tryna give Sarah a good meetup time
[11:46:05] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <Rabbit> that sounds fine to me, emersons still asleep but i can ask them whenever they get up :O
[11:46:11] [Async Chat Thread - #5/INFO]: <LunaMaiden> okie okie sick :>
